End-to-End MultiClass Dog Breed Classification
This notebook builds a deep classification model for dog breeds using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub

1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog

2. Data
Dog breed identification dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification

3. Evaluation
The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image . The one metric to use is Multi Class Log Loss

4. Features
We're dealing with images (unstrucutred data) of 120 different dog breeds ( 120 different classes) . We will use deep learning / transfer learning hopefully . The dataset itself is 10k+ images for the training set and 10k+ images for the test
